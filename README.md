# 30DaysOfStreamlit

Participating in this [challenge](https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/30days) because I really like Streamlit and have used it for my [Master Thesis](https://github.com/rhnfzl/business-process-dashboard-using-lstm) before and it was life saver. As I saw the post by [Streamlit on Twitter](https://twitter.com/streamlit/status/1509716484456558632) about this challenge it was no brainer for me.
